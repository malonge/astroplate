I’m Michael Alonge, a software engineer, computational biologist, and team lead with over a decade of experience at the intersection of genomics and software engineering. I specialize in building cloud-native, production-ready systems that scale with the demands of modern genomics and biotech.

Currently, I lead the design and development of Ohalo Genetics’ genomics data platform, managing a cross-functional team of engineers and scientists. I bring a proven track record of driving technical strategy, mentoring teams, and delivering reliable solutions, from leading large-scale genome assembly projects during my Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins, to designing scalable data pipelines that support gene editing, breeding, and intellectual property development in industry.

My work has been published in top journals including *Cell*, *Science*, and *Nature*, and I’ve created widely used bioinformatics software. In every role, I’ve paired technical expertise with leadership that enables teams to deliver faster, build more reliable systems, and translate complex science into production-ready software.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar and bass, experimenting with South Indian cooking, and following baseball.
